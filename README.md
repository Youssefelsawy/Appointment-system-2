A full-stack web application for managing medical appointments with support for patients, doctors, and administrators.

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- React
- Bootstrap

### Backend
- Node.js 
- Express 

## Project Setup

### Backend - frontend Setup
- I have deployed the website, backend on RailWay, frontend on Netlify and Database on Neon.tech
- And this is the website link: https://onnmed-appointment-system.netlify.app/
- Admin credentials to login as an admin -> email: admin@onnmed.com      password: 123456

## Project Approach (MVC Architecture)
  - Model-View-Controller Implementation
 
## Challenges Faced
- Managing appointment time slot conflicts required complex validation logic

- Implementing guest bookings without full user accounts was tricky

- Date/time handling across timezones needed special attention

- Grant specific Authrization for every role in the system

- Merge Front with Back in short time

- the whole process required to be completed in 48h

## Pending Items
- Nothing pending just enhancement
